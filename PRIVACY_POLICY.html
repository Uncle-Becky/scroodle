  <h1>Scroodle Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026-02-12</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains what information Scroodle ("the App") processes and how it is used.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data Processed</h2>
  <p>To operate gameplay, the App processes limited Reddit-provided context and gameplay events, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reddit user ID and username (for room membership and scoreboard display)</li>
    <li>Post/subreddit context needed for installation-scoped matchmaking</li>
    <li>Gameplay inputs (drawing points, guesses, system events)</li>
    <li>Operational metadata (timestamps, room and queue state)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How Data Is Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Match players into rooms and run rounds</li>
    <li>Synchronize realtime gameplay and scores</li>
    <li>Maintain service reliability and prevent abuse</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Storage and Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Gameplay state is stored in Reddit Devvit Redis for active sessions.</li>
    <li>Rooms and queue data are periodically cleaned up by scheduled tasks.</li>
    <li>No payment data is collected by this App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not sell personal data. Data is only processed as needed to provide gameplay through Reddit's Developer Platform.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>
    Reasonable safeguards are used within platform capabilities, including server-authoritative state handling and scoped settings/secrets.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App may fetch externally hosted word lists if configured by moderators (<code>wordlistUrl</code> setting). Usage of such sources is controlled by installation settings.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not directed to children under applicable minimum age requirements for Reddit platform usage.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>
    This policy may be updated periodically. Continued use of the App after updates indicates acceptance of the revised policy.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    For privacy questions related to this App, contact the app maintainer via the associated Reddit app listing.
